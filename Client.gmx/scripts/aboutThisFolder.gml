/*

A lot of the original code here makes references to built-in functions of
Visual Basic 6. The scripts in this folder are wrappers for those functions,
making them work the way the already written code wants to as needed.

Wherever I can, however, I'm avoiding using wrappers, as it's only
going to make things harder to understand if I keep everything so
separated.

Expect this section to mostly be the networking basics and perhaps some other
"this doesn't exist literally in Game Maker"-esque things.
