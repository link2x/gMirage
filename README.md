=======
A port of Mirage Source 4 from Visual Basic 6 to Game Maker: Studio.

What is Mirage Source?
=======
Mirage Source is a free engine for top-down ORPG games. It is originally distributed as a server and client in Visual Basic 6 source code.
One of the more popular games created from this engine is [Secrets of Mirage X](http://www.secretsofmirage.com/), which runs to this day.

=======
The plan is to port MS4 over as faithfully as possible. Some major changes will be necessary (packet structure, UI handling,
and other differences between the two languages), but the core of the system should be largely unchanged.

The engine will be released under the LGPL, allowing it to be used either in proprietary or open-source software.

Hopefully this will breathe new life into the engine, letting the large audience Game Maker has have easier access to
a full, modifiable system for producing ORPG games.


Setup / Extra Steps
======

The code being converted is included in the `Original Source` folder, but this disregards many files and settings.
Therefore, you may want to download the original source from [Key2Heaven](http://www.key2heaven.com/ms/forums/viewtopic.php?f=216&t=9847).
Visual Basic 6 is required for this.

Additionally, this project will not be including any of the original graphics, sound, or music of the original source.

It is also suggested to register at the Key2Heaven Forums and keep up with the [gMirage forum post](http://www.key2heaven.com/ms/forums/viewtopic.php?f=217&t=13599).
