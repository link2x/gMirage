=======
A port of Mirage Source 4 from Visual Basic 6 to Game Maker: Studio.

What is Mirage Source?
=======
Mirage Source is a free engine for top-down ORPG games. It is originally distributed as a server and client in Visual Basic 6 source code.
One of the more popular games created from this engine is [Secrets of Mirage X](http://www.secretsofmirage.com/), which runs to this day.

=======
The plan is to port MS4 over as faithfully as possible. Some major changes will be necessary (packet structure, UI handling,
and other differences between the two languages), but the core of the system should be largely unchanged.

The engine will be released under the LGPL, allowing it to be used either in proprietary or open-source software.

Hopefully this will breathe new life into the engine, letting the large audiance Game Maker has have easier access to
a full, modifiable system for producing ORPG games.


Setup
======

After opening the project inside of Game Maker: Studio, the folder name may be changed by Game Maker.
You will have to redirect your GitHub client to this folder.

Additionally, it is recommended that you download the original source from [Key2Heaven](http://www.key2heaven.com/ms/forums/viewtopic.php?f=216&t=9847).
Visual Basic 6 is required to view the source, however.

It is also suggested to register at the Key2Heaven Forums and keep up with the [gMirage forum post](http://www.key2heaven.com/ms/forums/viewtopic.php?f=217&t=13599).
